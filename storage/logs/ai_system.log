In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space", 'type': 'web_search', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space'}

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical physics and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement', 'type': 'context_aware', 'topic': 'explain quantum entanglement simple words.'}

With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is the second-most populous country after India, representing 17.4% of the world population. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land across an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers, making it the third-largest country by land area. The country is divided into 33 province-level divisions: 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, and 2 semi-autonomous special administrative regions. Beijing is the country's capital, while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center. Considered one of six cradles of civilization, China saw the first human inhabitants in the region arriving during the Paleolithic. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", 'type': 'learned', 'source': 'knowledge_base'}

DMT is used as a psychedelic drug and prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen. \nDMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the "businessman\'s trip" during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine', 'type': 'wikipedia', 'title': 'Dimethyltryptamine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine'}
