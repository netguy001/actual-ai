# AI Master Retrieval Prompt - Multi-Source AI System

## Overview

This document describes the **AI Master Retrieval Prompt** - a comprehensive system instruction that transforms your AI into an advanced multi-source information retrieval and verification system. The prompt has been integrated into your AI system to provide the most accurate, well-sourced, and reliable information possible.

## üéØ Core Capabilities

### Multi-Source Retrieval
- **Wikipedia API** - Encyclopedic knowledge with cross-verification
- **Web Search APIs** - Broad information coverage
- **News APIs** - Current events and real-time information
- **Specialized APIs** - Weather, time, academic, government sources
- **Academic Databases** - Peer-reviewed and authoritative sources

### Advanced Verification
- **Cross-Source Verification** - Facts verified across multiple independent sources
- **Source Quality Assessment** - Prioritizes authoritative sources
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handles contradictory information intelligently
- **Confidence Scoring** - Transparent confidence levels for all responses

### Intelligent Processing
- **Fact Extraction** - Extracts only relevant, verified information
- **Outdated Data Detection** - Identifies and flags outdated information
- **Mathematical Reasoning** - Solves math/logic problems internally
- **Context Awareness** - Understands query intent and context

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Enhanced Knowledge Retrieval Module
The AI Master Retrieval Prompt has been integrated into the `KnowledgeRetrievalModule` with the following enhancements:

```python
# Enhanced source configuration
self.sources = {
    "wikipedia": {"priority": 2, "quality": "medium"},
    "web_search": {"priority": 1, "quality": "high"},
    "news": {"priority": 3, "quality": "high"},
    "academic": {"priority": 1, "quality": "high"},
    "government": {"priority": 1, "quality": "high"}
}
```

### Multi-Source Synthesis
The system now follows a sophisticated 8-step process:

1. **Query Analysis** - Determines optimal source combination
2. **Parallel Retrieval** - Fetches from multiple sources simultaneously
3. **Fact Extraction** - Extracts key factual statements
4. **Cross-Verification** - Verifies facts across multiple sources
5. **Conflict Resolution** - Handles contradictory information
6. **Confidence Calculation** - Determines overall confidence level
7. **Response Formatting** - Formats according to Master Retrieval Protocol
8. **Quality Assurance** - Ensures accuracy and relevance

## üìã Response Format

All responses now follow the **Master Retrieval Protocol** format:

```
[DIRECT ANSWER]
The verified answer to your question...

[REASONING]
I synthesized this answer from X independent sources, 
cross-verifying Y key facts between multiple sources.

[SOURCES]
- Source 1: [Title] (URL) - Confidence: 0.85
- Source 2: [Title] (URL) - Confidence: 0.78

[CONFIDENCE]
High confidence (0.82) based on source agreement and cross-verification.

[ADDITIONAL CONTEXT]
Cross-verified facts: 3 key facts confirmed across multiple sources.
```

## üîç Source Quality Assessment

### High Priority Sources (Weight: 1.5x)
- Peer-reviewed academic journals
- Government websites (.gov)
- Educational institutions (.edu)
- Established news organizations
- Official documentation

### Medium Priority Sources (Weight: 1.0x)
- Wikipedia (with cross-verification)
- Reputable blogs and expert opinions
- Industry reports

### Low Priority Sources (Weight: 0.5x)
- Social media posts
- Unverified user-generated content
- Single-source claims

## üéØ Decision Logic

### When to Use External Retrieval
- **Factual Lookups** - Information about people, places, events
- **Current Events** - News, weather, time-sensitive information
- **Complex Topics** - Scientific, historical, technical subjects
- **Verification** - Confirming information from multiple sources

### When to Use Internal Reasoning
- **Mathematical Problems** - Calculations, equations, formulas
- **Logical Reasoning** - Step-by-step problem solving
- **Conceptual Questions** - Understanding and explanation
- **Creative Tasks** - Analysis and synthesis

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Factual Lookup
```
User: "Who is Albert Einstein?"

System Response:
[DIRECT ANSWER]
Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.

[REASONING]
I synthesized this answer from 3 independent sources, cross-verifying 4 key facts.

[SOURCES]
- Source 1: Wikipedia - Albert Einstein (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) - Confidence: 0.92
- Source 2: Nobel Prize Official Site (https://www.nobelprize.org) - Confidence: 0.95

[CONFIDENCE]
High confidence (0.93) based on authoritative sources and cross-verification.
```

### Example 2: Mathematical Problem
```
User: "What is 15 * 23?"

System Response:
[DIRECT ANSWER]
15 * 23 = 345

[REASONING]
I solved this mathematical calculation internally using multiplication.

[CONFIDENCE]
High confidence (1.00) - mathematical calculation.
```

### Example 3: Current Information
```
User: "What's the current weather in London?"

System Response:
[DIRECT ANSWER]
Current weather in London: 18¬∞C, Partly cloudy, Humidity: 65%

[REASONING]
I retrieved this information from real-time weather API.

[SOURCES]
- Source 1: wttr.in Weather API (https://wttr.in/London) - Confidence: 0.90

[CONFIDENCE]
High confidence (0.90) - real-time data from reliable weather service.
```
